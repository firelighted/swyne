Hierarchy with entities as a linear group of node.
Signals for joining and un-joining the master tree?
No such thing as an entity? inspector knows how to group nodes in a sequence?

Serialization of entities and images, sprite sheets
    - How to get the set of class names?

Subtree features:
    - Can register a controller as member of several subtrees.
    - Can access parent/children in a particular sub-tree.
    - What should happen at top level of a subtree?
        - Listen to window events.

Other things:
    - You need examples of these things before you can even think about
        whether you support them:
        - Caching? Probably will be doable, since subtrees can store whatever they want.
        - Quadtree feature for drawing only stuff on screen or colliding only nearby things.
            Not in a position yet to decide if this is doable. Look at quadtrees later.
    - The true test of this system is the inspector.

Todo:
    - Serialization system with text editor.
            - To what extent is this not Kivy?
            - Kivy has a lot lot lot more than this.
    - Image serialization
    - Demo: Spritesheet editor (to show focus system)
    - Demo: Simple platformer (with rotation?) (to build collision system)
    - Turn both of these into tutorial.md and executables
    - Build your own game.
    - Have a repl. DONE

Trees: 
    - Layout Engine
    - Collision system.
    - Drawing
    - Focus system


No subclassing entity. That's done via prefabs.
